        <h1 class="heading--big">The prototypal nature of JavaScript</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">The inheritance model in JavaScript always raises many questions. It can be confusing,
            especially for
            programmers coming from class-based languages, like Java, C# or Python. In this article, we take a
            closer look at the prototypal nature of JavaScript.</p>
        <h2 class="heading--medium" id="how-to-create-objects-in-javascript">How to create objects in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">JavaScript supports many paradigms. One of them is object-oriented programming. In contrast
            to other
            known OOP languages, JavaScript doesn't have the concept of classes. Inheritance is done using
            prototypes.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->

        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">How then are we supposed to create objects if there are no
        classes? Well,
        there is a couple of options.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To create a single object, you can use the object literal syntax. Just put a bunch of
            properties between
            curly braces and assign it to a variable.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">var john = {
    name: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    yearOfBirth: 1990
}
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">Now, you can access these properties, either with dot or
        bracket
        notation.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Dot notation
john.name

// Bracket notation
john['name']
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">It works fine when you want a single object, but what if you
        need many
        similar objects? In that situation, use a function constructor.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">So-called function constructors are just regular functions, but their responsibility is to
            create new
            objects. You can think about them as blueprints.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">function Person(name, lastName, yearOfBirth) {
    this.name = name;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
}
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">To create an object with that constructor, use the
        <code>new</code> operator.
    </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const john = new Person('John', 'Doe', 1990);
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">The <code>new</code> operator creates an empty object, passes
        it to the
        constructor function as the value of <code>this</code> and links the newly created object with the prototype
        object of the Person constructor. More about that later.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In return, we get the object with properties defined inside the Person constructor, so the
            name,
            lastName, and yearOfBirth.</p>
        <h2 class="heading--medium" id="what-is-the-prototype">What is the prototype?</h2>
        <blockquote>In JavaScript, every object has its prototype, but only functions have the prototype property.
        </blockquote>
        <p class="paragraph">I know this sentence sounds confusing, so let me break it down into two parts.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Functions have the prototype property.</strong> What exactly does it mean? As you
            may have heard,
            functions in JavaScript, are a special type of objects. It means they can have properties, like every
            other object. One of these properties is the prototype property, which by default, stores a reference to
            an empty object.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">function Person(name, lastName, yearOfBirth) {
    this.name = name;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
}

console.log(Person.prototype); // empty object
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">We can fill this empty object with properties and methods that
        are inherited
        by the instances of the Person constructor.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">function Person(name, lastName, yearOfBirth) {
    this.name = name;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
}

Person.prototype.calcAge = function() {
    const year = new Date().getFullYear();
    return year - this.yearOfBirth;
}

const john = new Person('John', 'Doe', 1990);

console.log(john.calcAge()); // 29
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">The john object inherits the <code>calcAge</code> method
        because it's an
        instance of the Person constructor. We can create other objects using the same constructor, and all of them
        inherit the <code>calcAge</code> method.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const john = new Person('John', 'Doe', 1990);
const mike = new Person('Mike', 'Smith', 1995);
const jane = new Person('Jane', 'Wilson', 2000);

console.log(john.calcAge()); // 29
console.log(mike.calcAge()); // 24
console.log(jane.calcAge()); // 19
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">Let's take care of the second part of the sentence. <strong>Every
        object has
        its prototype. </strong>It means that in JavaScript, every possible object is an instance of some
        constructor, and inherits from the prototype object of this constructor.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Remember when the john object inherited the <code>calcAge</code> method from the
            <code>Person.prototype</code> object? The same thing applies to every single object in JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Take a look at arrays. You can create an array using the literal syntax (square brackets),
            but you can
            also use the Array constructor.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Array literal syntax
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

// Array constructor
const arr2 = new Array(1, 2, 3);
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">Both lines create arrays with three elements. What does it
        mean? That arrays
        are objects, instances of the Array constructor.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It also means that arrays inherit from the <code>Array.prototype</code>. I'm sure you know
            the <code>forEach</code>
            method used to iterate through the array. Guess what? This method comes from the
            <code>Array.prototype</code>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">[1, 2, 3].forEach(el =&gt; {
    console.log(el);
});
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">Additionally, you can always check the prototype of an object
        with <code>Object.getPrototypeOf()</code>
        method.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const arr = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(arr));
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 class="heading--medium" id="prototypes-have-their-prototypes">Prototypes have
        their prototypes</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">If prototypes are objects, does it mean they also have their prototypes? And if so, what is
            the prototype
            of the prototype?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We know that prototypes are just simple objects. We also know that every single object in
            JavaScript has
            its prototype, from which it inherits properties and methods. All objects in JavaScript are descended
            from <code>Object</code> , which means they inherit from the <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To prove this, create an empty object and check its prototype.</p>
        <!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf({}));
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">The same thing applies to functions. Functions are a special
        type of objects,
        which means they are created with the <code>Function</code> constructor and inherit from the <code>Function.prototype</code>
        .</p>
        <h2 class="heading--medium" id="the-prototype-chain">The prototype chain</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Let's take a look at how the JavaScript interpreter finds the method in the chain of the
            prototypes.</p>
        <!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">function Person(name, lastName, yearOfBirth) {
    this.name = name;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
}

const john = new Person('John', 'Doe', 1990);

console.log(john.toString());
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">We have the john object that is an instance of the Person
        constructor, which
        means it inherits from the <code>Person.prototype</code> object. We want to call the <code>toString</code>
        method, which sits in the <code>Object.prototype</code>. How is the interpreter able to find this method?
    </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The JavaScript interpreter first checks if the <code>toString</code> method exists in the
            john object. It
            doesn't, so the interpreter looks for this method in the <code>Person.prototype</code> object. It can't
            find it here, so it moves up to the next prototype in the chain, which is the
            <code>Object.prototype</code> . It finally finds the <code>toString</code> there and calls this method
            on the john object.</p>
        <h2 class="heading--medium" id="why-use-prototypes">Why use prototypes?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Why would I even place a method in the prototype if I can just put it in the constructor
            function?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">That's true, but there are benefits behind prototypes. &nbsp;Compare these two code
            samples.</p>
        <!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">function Person(name, lastName, yearOfBirth) {
    this.name = name;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
    this.calcAge = function() {
        const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
        return currentYear - this.yearOfBirth;
    }
}

const john = new Person('John', 'Doe', 1990);

console.log(john);
</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">In this example, the <code>calcAge</code> method is added
        directly to the
        instance of the Person constructor. Use the <code>console.log()</code> method to see that the

            declared only

        <h2 class="heading--medium" id="the-__proto__-property">The __proto__ property</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">In the last example, you might have seen the strange-looking <code>__proto__</code>

            <figcaption>The <code>__proto__</code> property</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraph">The <code>__proto__</code> property is a function that allows us to get and set the
            prototype of an
            object. In the case of the john object, the <code>__proto__</code> returns the
            <code>Person.prototype</code> object.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Note that the use of the <code>__proto__</code> property is not recommended anymore. To get
            a prototype
            of an object, use the <code>Object.getPrototypeOf()</code> method.</p>
        <h2 class="heading--medium" id="the-object-create-method">The Object.create() method</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">In some cases, you may want to specify the prototype for your newly created object without
            declaring any
            constructor functions. The <code>Object</code> has a special method for that.</p>

    }
}

const mike = Object.create(john);
mike.name = 'Mike';
mike.lastName = 'Smith';
mike.yearOfBirth = 1995;

</code></pre>
        <!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p class="paragraph">The <code>Object.create()</code> method allows us to specify
        the prototype
        for the newly created object. In this case, the mike object uses the john object as its prototype, which
        allows Mike to use the <code>calcAge</code> method.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This method is useful to implement so-called classical inheritance known from the
            class-based languages,
            but more on that in another article.</p>
        <h2 class="heading--medium" id="classes-in-javascript">Classes in JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">We determined earlier that JavaScript is a prototype-based language that doesn't have the
            concept of
            classes. However, the ES6 standard introduces a new class syntax to JavaScript.</p>
        <!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->

        syntactical
        sugar, which means that behind the scenes, JavaScript is still based on prototypes. It's just a syntax that

            using prototypes is more efficient and saves up memory because a method is declared only once, in a
